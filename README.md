# Welcome to my Personal Website

The goal of this website is to let everyone know a little bit about myself and the things I'm currently doing. 
I tend to jump around from project to project, so pray this gets finished before I find a new interesting idea.
I've tried creating this exact project multiple times, but it's never really panned out. It's about that time. 

## Concepts

The website will includes details about me and how to contact me on various platforms.
